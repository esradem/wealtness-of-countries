# Esra's Portfolio Project

# Introduction
## Aim:
The aim of this project is to conduct a thorough analysis of the total wealth of nations over a specified period, with an emphasis on the dynamics of human and natural capital per capita. By integrating and visualizing data related to employment among men and women worldwide, the project seeks to uncover patterns and disparities in economic participation and wealth accumulation. This analysis aims to provide a deeper understanding of how human and natural resources contribute to national wealth, facilitating insights into sustainable development and economic policy.
## Scope:
- The scope of the project includes the following elements:

1.  Data Acquisition and Preparation: Collection of relevant data on total national wealth, including specific metrics on human capital and natural capital per capita from reliable sources. This involves cleaning and preparing the data using Python and Jupyter Notebook to ensure accuracy and usability.
2. Database Management: Development of a structured PostgreSQL database to efficiently manage and query large datasets, enabling robust data handling and manipulation.
3. Data Analysis: Comparative analysis of employment rates between men and women globally to identify gender disparities and their correlation with national wealth metrics. The project also involves identifying the top five countries in terms of total wealth to analyze their economic structures and resource utilization.
4. Visualization and Reporting: Utilization of Power BI for dynamic visualization of the data, enabling the exploration of complex relationships and trends in a user-friendly manner. This will include interactive charts and graphs that facilitate a deeper understanding of the data.
5.  Future Trends: The project will also explore predictive insights into future trends in national wealth and employment patterns, providing a foundation for proactive policy planning and development strategies.


## Data Collection
### Sources:
This dataset is collected from Kaggle and various website.

### Metrics:
The primary metrics involved in this analysis include:

Human Capital Per Capita: This includes data on education levels, employment rates, and health metrics.
Natural Capital Per Capita: This comprises data on natural resources such as forests, minerals, and energy reserves.
Employment Rates: Specific focus on gender-based employment statistics, comparing male and female workforce participation rates globally.
Total Wealth: The overall economic value of natural and human capital, along with produced capital.

### Data Analysis:
+ Cleaning and Normalizing Data: Ensuring data consistency through the removal of null values and standardizing measurement scales.

+ Data Integration: Combining multiple datasets into a single coherent database for in-depth analysis.

+ Comparative Analysis: Evaluating the wealth and employment data by gender and between countries to identify trends and disparities.
###  Tools and Techniques:
 + Python: Utilized for data manipulation and cleaning.
 - Psycopg2 is  PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
 + Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
built on top of the Python programming language.

- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visualization scripting.
+ PostgreSQL: Database management for storing and querying large datasets.
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to present the findings.

   

# Prerequirement 
+ Psycopg: A PostgreSQL adapter for Python, used for connecting Python to the PostgreSQL database.
- Jupyter Notebook: An open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
+ PostgreSQL Database: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- Pandas: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis.

## Setup
Setting up the environment involves:

1. Installing Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Database Installation: Install PostgreSQL and set up a local database server.
3. Library Installation: Install Pandas, Psycopg, and any other necessary Python libraries using pip.
## Step by step 
+ Environment Preparation: Set up your Python environment and install necessary libraries (Pandas, Psycopg).
+ Database Configuration: Configure PostgreSQL, open Shell Script and use your password to configure postgreSQL<br />

+ After configuration you can open Jupyter Notebook and prepare, clean, manipulate data. 



###   Data Import and Cleaning:
 Use Python scripts in Jupyter Notebook to import, clean, and prepare your data.
### Data Analysis and Visualization:
- Conduct analysis using Python and SQL queries.
- Create tables in Jupyter Notebook to explore data patterns.
- Export data to Power BI for more advanced visual reporting.
+ Insights and Reporting: Synthesize findings into actionable insights and prepare a final report in Power BI.
